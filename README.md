A go library for logging, monitoring and error handling tailored for Gin and GCP

## Use case

This library contains ready-to-use functions for logging, monitoring and error handling for my
projects. It is tailored to be developer friendly, when running locally for development purpose and
fits to the logging of Google Cloud Platform for production.

For writing HTTP services, I prefer to use Gin, therefore there are also setup functions to use this
setup with a Gin server.
